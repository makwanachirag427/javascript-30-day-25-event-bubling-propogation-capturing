# JavaScript30: Day 25 - Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling, and Once

This is the README for Day 25 of the JavaScript30 challenge, focusing on Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling, and the `once` event listener option.

## Introduction

In this challenge, we delve into understanding event propagation, specifically event capture and event bubbling, and learn how to use the `once` option with event listeners to trigger an event only once.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Concepts Covered

- Event propagation (capture and bubbling)
- `addEventListener` options (capture, once)
- Stopping propagation with `stopPropagation()`
- Understanding the `this` keyword in event listeners

## Setup

Simply open the provided `index.html` file in a web browser to view and interact with the example.

## Instructions

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Explore the example to see how event propagation (capture and bubbling) works.
3. Observe how the `once` option behaves when added to an event listener.
4. Open the browser's developer console to see additional log outputs for better understanding.

## Usage

Feel free to modify the provided code in `index.html` and experiment with the event listeners, event propagation, and the `once` option to deepen your understanding of these concepts.
